    "# Debug Plan\n",
    "1.  **Analyze Crash Cause**:\n",
    "    *   `InitSecurityHooks` runs in `initialize` (constructor).\n",
    "    *   It calls `ActivateBypass` and `HOOK`, which use `getRealOffset`.\n",
    "    *   `getRealOffset` searches dependent libraries (UnityFramework).\n",
    "    *   At constructor time, `UnityFramework` might not be loaded yet.\n",
    "    *   Result: `getRealOffset` returns 0 (or Main base). Writing to 0 or wrong base -> Crash.\n",
    "    *   Also, `0x1048041B8` implies a base of `0x100000000`, which is incorrect for a relative offset addition if the base is effectively added twice or mismatched.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Proposed Fix**:\n",
    "    *   Delay Game-Specific Hooks until `UnityFramework` is detected.\n",
    "    *   Fix the `0x1048041B8` offset to `0x48041B8`.\n",
    "    *   Split `InitSecurityHooks` into `InitSystemHooks` (safe, immediate) and `InitGameHooks` (delayed).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Action Steps**:\n",
    "    *   Modify `savagexiter.mm`:\n",
    "        *   Wait for Unity in `hack_thread`.\n",
    "        *   Move `ActivateBypass` and `HOOK(0x52AC18)` to the delayed execution path.\n",
    "        *   Update `hooking` offset.\n",
    "    *   Build and Deploy.\n"
